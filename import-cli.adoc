[#importing-a-cluster]
= Importing a cluster

After you install the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator, you are ready to import a cluster to manage. Using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI, you can import a cluster using the `kubeconfig` file of the cluster you are importing. Alternatively, you can run import commands manually on the cluster you are importing. Both procedures are available in this documentation.

See the following procedure to import from the CLI:

* <<cli-prerequisites,Prerequisites>>
* <<prepare-for-import,Prepare for import>>
* <<importing-wth-the-kubeconfig-file,Importing with the kubeconfig file>>
* <<importing-with-manual-commands,Importing with manual commands>>
* <<detaching-managed-cluster,Detaching a managed cluster>>

[#cli-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* You can use Linux (x86_64, s390x, ppc64le) or macOS.
* Ensure you installed the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operater and installed the MultiClusterEngine custom resource on a Kubernetes cluster.
* You need a another separate cluster that you want to manage and Internet connectivity.
* You need the OpenShift Container Platform CLI version 4.6 or later, to run `oc` commands. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] for information about installing and configuring the Red Hat OpenShift CLI, `oc`.

+
*Note:* Download the installation file for CLI tools from the  OpenShift Container Platform console.

* If you are importing a cluster that was not created by OpenShift Container Platform, you need a `multiclusterengine.spec.imagePullSecret` defined. This secret might have been created when multicluster engine for Kubernetes was installed. See link:../adv_config_install.adoc#custom-image-pull-secret[Custom Image Pull Secret] for more information about defining the secret. 

[#prepare-for-import]
== Prepare for import

. Log in to your _engine cluster_. The _engine cluster_ is the cluster that contains the the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operater and the custom resource. Run the following command:
+
----
oc login
----

. Run the following command on the engine cluster to create the namespace: 
+
*Note:* The cluster name that is defined in `CLUSTER_NAME` and is also used as the cluster namespace in the `.yaml` file and commands:

+
----
oc new-project ${CLUSTER_NAME}
oc label namespace ${CLUSTER_NAME} cluster.open-cluster-management.io/managedCluster=${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

. Edit the example `ManagedCluster` with the following sample of YAML:

+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
----

. Save the file as `managed-cluster.yaml`.
. Apply the YAML file with the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f managed-cluster.yaml
----

[#importing-wth-the-kubeconfig-file]
== Importing with the kubeconfig file

Proceed with the following steps while still logged in to your engine cluster:

. Retrieve the `kubeconfig` file of the cluster that you are importing. See the documenation for your Kubernetes cluster to learn where to locate your `kubeconfig` file.

. Generate the import secret in the `${CLUSTER_NAME}` namespace using the `kubeconfig` file of the cluster you are importing. Run the following command:

+
----
oc create secret generic auto-import-secret --from-file=kubeconfig=./path/to/kubeconfig-file -n ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

+
*Note:* The import secret is used one time and deleted when the import process completes.

. Validate the `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE` status for your imported cluster. Run the following command from the multicluster engine for Kubernetes cluster:

+
----
oc get managedcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

Proceed with the following steps in the separate cluster that you are importing:

. Log in to the cluster that you are importing. Run the following command:

+
----
oc login
----

. Validate the pod status on the cluster that you are importing. Run the following command:

+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent
----

. Add-ons will be installed after the cluster that you are importing is `AVAILABLE`. Validate the pod status of add-ons on the cluster. Run the following command:

+
----
kubectl get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

Your cluster is now imported.

[#importing-with-manual-commands]
== Importing with manual command

*Important:* The import command contains pull secret information that is copied to each of the imported clusters. Anyone who can access the imported clusters can also view the pull secret information.

Proceed with the following steps while still logged in to your engine cluster:

. Obtain the `klusterlet-crd.yaml` that was generated by the import controller on your engine cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-import -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} -o jsonpath={.data.crds\\.yaml} | base64 --decode > klusterlet-crd.yaml
----

. Obtain the `import.yaml` that was generated by the import controller on your engine cluster.
Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-import -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} -o jsonpath={.data.import\\.yaml} | base64 --decode > import.yaml
----

Proceed with the following steps in the separate cluster that you are importing:

. Log in to the cluster that you are importing.

+
----
oc login
----

. Apply the `klusterlet-crd.yaml` that was generated in step 1.
Run the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f klusterlet-crd.yaml
----

. Apply the `import.yaml` file that was generated in step 2.
Run the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f import.yaml
----

. Validate the pod status on the cluster you are importing.
Run the following command:
+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent
----

. Validate `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE` status for your imported cluster.
Run the following command from the _engine_ cluster:
+
----
oc get managedcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

. Addons will be installed after the cluster you are importing is `AVAILABLE`. Validate the pod status of addons on the cluster you are importing.
Run the following command:
+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

Your cluster is now imported.

[#detaching-managed-cluster]
== Detaching a managed cluster

To detach a managed cluster from the multicluster engine for Kubernetes cluster, run the following command:

----
oc delete managedcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

Your cluster is now detached.
