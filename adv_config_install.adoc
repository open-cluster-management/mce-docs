[#advanced-config-engine]
= Advanced configuration 

The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator is installed using an operator that deploys all of the required components. The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator can be further configured during or after installation by adding one or more of the following attributes to the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource:

[#custom-image-pull-secret]
== Custom Image Pull Secret

If you plan to import Kubernetes clusters that were not created by OpenShift Container Platform or 
multicluster engine for Kubernetes, generate a secret that contains your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret information to access the entitled content from the distribution registry. 

The secret requirements for OpenShift Container Platform clusters are automatically resolved by OpenShift Container Platform and multicluster engine for Kubernetes, so you do not have to create the secret if you are not importing other types of Kubernetes clusters to be managed.

*Important:* These secrets are namespace-specific, so make sure that you are in the namespace that you use for your engine.

 . Download your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret file from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] by selecting *Download pull secret*. Your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.

 . Run the following command to create your secret:
+
----
oc create secret generic <secret> -n <namespace> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path-to-pull-secret> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
- Replace `secret` with the name of the secret that you want to create.
- Replace `namespace` with your project namespace, as the secrets are namespace-specific.
- Replace `path-to-pull-secret` with the path to your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret that you downloaded.

The following example displays the template to use if you want to use a custom pull secret. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace. Replace `secret` with the name of your pull secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----


[#target-namespace]
== Target namespace

The operands can be installed in a designated namespace by specifying a location in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource. This namespace is created upon application of the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource.

*Important:* If no target namespace is specified, the namespace of the operator is used for the operands and is stated in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource specification.

The following example displays the template that you can use to specify a target namespace. Replace `target` with the name of your destination namespace:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  targetNamespace: <target>
----

*Note:* The `target` namespace cannot be the `default` namespace.
