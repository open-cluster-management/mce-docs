= Requirements and recommendations

Before you install the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator 1.0, review the following system configuration requirements and settings:

* <<supported-operating-systems-and-platforms,Supported operating systems and platforms>>
* <<network-configuration,Network configuration>>

*Best practice:* Install multicluster engine for Kubernetes on a cluster that is not a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management cluster. Multicluster engine for Kubernetes is _not_ compatible with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. 

*Note:* There is no console for the Technical Preview version of this technology.
